# The C Programming Language
These are my solutions for the exercises in Brain Kernighan and
Dennis Ritchie's *The C Programming Language, Second Edition*.

*The C Programming Language* (particularly its second edition) documented
usage instructions for... well... the C programming language, as of its
1989 standardized version, known as [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C).

Exercises can be found across the book at the end of chapters. My answers
to these exercises have been made public here.

# The Book
The exact book I'm using is:
* Kernighan, B. W., &amp; Ritchie, D. M. (1988). The C programming language (Second Edition). Prentice-Hall. ISBN 0-13-110370-9.
** The specific book I'm using is from the Map√∫a University Main Libary, [QA76.73.C15K47 1998](https://mu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/63MU_INST/tigdca/alma991000679789707136).
** You can buy a copy of the book from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-2nd-Ed/dp/0131103709) (hardbound).

deviates from the original instruction while retaining its original purpose.

# Running
This assumes you have `gcc` installed and is accessible from the standard Windows
command line (`cmd.exe`). To run exercise 1-1:
```cmd
run.bat 1-1
```

# License
I claim no originality from the code here, as it is patterned and produced
from the instructions of a copyrighted work. Wherever there may be sufficient
